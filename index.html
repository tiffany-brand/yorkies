        <h2>Some Cool Yorkie Facts</h2>

        <p>The Yorkshire Terrier is one of the smallest dog breed of terrier type, and of any dog breed. The breed developed during the 19th century in Yorkshire, England. Ideally its maximum size is
            7 pounds (3.2 kg). A popular companion dog, the Yorkshire Terrier has also been part of the development of other breeds, such as the Silky Terrier. It has a grey, black and tan coat, and
            the breed's nickname is Yorkie.</p>
        <p>Yorkshire Terriers are very playful and energetic dogs. Many people who have a Yorkie as a pet have two, because they often have separation anxiety when left alone and "they donâ€™t enjoy
            being alone."</p>
